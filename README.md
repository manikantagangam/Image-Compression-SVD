# Image-Compression-SVD

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates image compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is a mathematical technique that can be used to compress and reconstruct images with a reduced number of singular values. This technique can help reduce image file sizes while preserving essential visual information.

## Introduction

In this Jupyter Notebook, you will find examples of how to compress and reconstruct images using SVD. The notebook includes both grayscale and color image compression examples. You can adjust the number of singular values to experiment with different compression levels and see how they affect image quality.

## Prerequisites

Before using this notebook, you should have the following prerequisites:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-image)

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image
```
